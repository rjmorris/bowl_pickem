            <p>
              Participants pick the winners of 39 bowl games. They assign a
              confidence score to each game in the range 1-39, with every value
              used exactly once. Standings are based on the sum of the
              confidence scores for the correctly picked games.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the graphic, the height of a bar represents the confidence
              score assigned to the game. The color represents whether the pick
              was correct. Hovering over a bar will highlight the corresponding
              game for all other participants. The highlight is larger and
              brighter when the other participant picked a different winner than
              the participant whose bar is being hovered over.
